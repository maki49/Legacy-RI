# Readme

This repository is just a backup of the directory `source/src_ri` from  [ABACUS](https://github.com/deepmodeling/abacus-develop). 

It would be deleted after my refactor. 

However, 


the author, [@PeizeLin](https://github.com/PeizeLin), may need to refer to it in the future.

Besides, 

**I regard his codes as some kind of artwork or masterpiece, how am I willing to delete them?**


So I decide to upload the backup onto Github.

See? 

So much to play with in C++11.
